## Code Challenge: Sock Sales by Match
There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are. 

Function must return an integer representing the number of matching pairs of socks that are available.

* n: number of socks in pile
* ar: color codes of each sock

#### Example 1.
For example, there are `n = 7` socks with colors `ar = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]`. There is one pair of color `1` and one of color `2`. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is `2`.

#### Example 2.
```
Input: n = 9, ar = [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20]
Output: 3
```
